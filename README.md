**Package Class Implementation**
**Overview**
The Package Class Implementation is a C++ program that simulates managing a package or box. It includes functionality to load, empty, and display box information, as well as overload operators for efficient display of package details. The program uses class constructors, member functions for box operations, and operator overloading to provide a complete solution for managing package dimensions and contents.

**Key Features:**
Data Members: Manages dimensions (length, width, height) and contents of the box.
Constructors: Default constructor for setting a safe state, and an overloaded constructor for initializing dimensions.
**Member Functions:**
buildBox: Initializes the box with given dimensions.
loadBox: Loads contents into the box, checking if the box is already loaded.
emptyBox: Empties the box and returns the previous contents.
boxIsEmpty: Checks if the box is empty.
displayBoxInfo: Displays box dimensions and contents.
Operator Overloading: Overloads the << operator for displaying package details in a formatted manner.
